# Elettromagnetismo
# Electromagnetism Simulations

This repository contains a collection of **Matlab scripts** developed for the *Electromagnetism* course.  
The goal of these projects is to **simulate, visualize, and analyze electric fields and potentials** in two and three dimensions.

## Project Overview
Each script focuses on a specific concept of electromagnetism, using Matlab for numerical computation and graphical visualization.

### Main Scripts
- `Campo_Elettrico_Bidimensionale.m` – Simulation of a two-dimensional electric field.  
- `Campo_Elettrico_Lungo_R.m` – Electric field analysis along the radial direction.  
- `Campo_Elettrico_Lungo_z.m` – Electric field behavior along the z-axis.  
- `Campo_Elettrico_Tridimensionale.m` – 3D visualization of electric field vectors.  
- `Comandi_Generali_Matlab.m` – General Matlab commands and setup for simulations.  
- `Differenza_Di_Potenziale.m` – Calculation and visualization of potential difference.  
- `Grafico_Campo_Elettrico.m` – Graphical representation of electric field lines and magnitude.  
- `Potenziale_con_z_Fissato.m` – Potential distribution with fixed z-coordinate.  

*(and additional related Matlab scripts)*

## Features
- 2D and 3D visualization of electric field vectors  
- Potential surface plotting  
- Interactive exploration of field intensity  
- Modular Matlab code, easy to modify for new configurations  

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open any `.m` file in **Matlab**.  
3. Run the script to generate electric field and potential plots.  
4. Adjust parameters inside the code to experiment with different charge configurations.

## Objective
This project demonstrates the use of **Matlab for electromagnetism simulations**, combining theoretical physics with computational visualization to better understand field and potential behavior.
